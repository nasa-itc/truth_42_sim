# TRUTH_42_SIM - Simulator to Provide 42 Truth Data

Simple simulator to connect to 42 and provide packed telemetry to COSMOS.  This is not a NOS3 simulator in the traditional sense, since it does not simulate hardware connected to the CPU.  It is provided as a convenience to be able to stream and read 42 data in COSMOS.
